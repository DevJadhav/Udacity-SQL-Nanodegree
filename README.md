# Udacity SQL Nanodegree Program
In this repo, it contains the projects I worked on for the SQL Nanodegree course on Udacity. Each course is separated into directories. For each directory, all of the required files for each course's project can be found in the directory. Please take note that the actual database contents that ultimately completes the project are not included due to the data being internally stored on Udacity. However, the SQL queries that I built to complete the projects are available.

Also note that the flavour of SQL seen in this nanodegree is Postgres.


### [Project 1: Deforestation Exploration](https://github.com/DevJadhav/Udacity-SQL-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Deforestation%20Exploration)

This project performs an exploration of the available data acquired from a fictional company called ForestQuery where we need to answer some questions about deforestation situations around the world, then provide suggestions on what we need to do next. The completed report template as well as all SQL queries to answer the questions about the data are included. Please note that the actual data is not available with this repo due to it being internally stored on Udacity but the queries are still available for use.


### [Project 2: Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator](https://github.com/DevJadhav/Udacity-SQL-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Udiddit)

This project aims to redefine a badly laid out schema and data model for a social news aggregator website so that we can better scale the users and provide better maintainability over time. The aim is to investigate the current schema, note the disadvantages of the bad schema, then propose a new schema and finally insert the data provided from the old schema into the new schema. A subset of the data used with the old data model is available and the objective is to use this subset and migrate it to the new schema.
