# Udacity SQL Nanodegree 
Master SQL, the core language for Big Data analysis and enable insight-driven decision-making and strategy for business.

### Part 1 - Introduction to SQL

* Execute core SQL commands to define, select, manipulate, control access, aggregate and join data tables. 
* Understand when and how to use subqueries, window functions as well as partitions to complete complex tasks. 
* Clean data, optimize SQL queries and write select advanced JOINs to enhance analysis performance. 
* Explain which cases to use particular SQL commands and apply query results to address business problems.

### [Project 1: Deforestation Exploration](https://github.com/DevJadhav/Udacity-SQL-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Deforestation%20Exploration)

Act as a Data Analyst for a non-profit organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic.
* Prepare a report for the executive team to understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016. 
* Identifying the most concerning regions and countries experiencing severe drop in forest area to determine where to concentrate efforts to combat deforestation.
* Techniques used: Create View, Table; Boolean Operators; Aggregations, Window Functions, Joins, CASE Statements


### Part 2 - Management of Relational & Non-Relational Databases

* Databases need to be structured properly to enable efficient and effective querying and analysis of data. 
* Build normalized, consistent and performant relational data models. 
* Use SQL Database Definition Language (DDL) to create the data schemas designed in Postgres and apply SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) to migrate data from a denormalized schema to a normalized one. 
* Understand the tradeoffs between relational databases and their non-relational counterparts and justify which one is best for different scenarios. 
* With a radical shift of paradigms, learn about MongoDB and Redis to get an understanding of the differences in behaviors and requirements for non-relational databases.


### [Project 2: Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator](https://github.com/DevJadhav/Udacity-SQL-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Udiddit)

Build the supporting data structure for Udiddit (similar to Reddit), a social media news aggregator site. Design a new, normalized and performant database and migrate over data from the previously poorly designed database.
